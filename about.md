# Template Mod

Simple "Higher or lower" game, guess which level has more downloads.
Menu can be found in the bottom left of the creator menu. Have fun!

This is pretty sloppy so if the game crashes idk just uninstall or smth idc, level thumbnails should be supported once their media server works again. Dont expect good code when looking at the Github.


## Planned (only if i am bored some day):

Setting for the filters (what levels are used)
Setting for likes/downloads
Saving Highscores
